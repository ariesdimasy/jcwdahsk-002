            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
            who can
            help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
            only say
            wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I
            never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to
            the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
            interviews as an
            example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
            receiving
            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
